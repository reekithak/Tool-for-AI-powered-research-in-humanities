              "'Goods also give rise to a similar fluctuation because they bring harm to many people for before now men have been undone by reason of their wealth, and others by reason of their courage. So too is it, then, in the case of temperance and courage and the other virtues. For the man who flies from and fears everything and does not stand his ground against anything becomes a coward, and the man who fears nothing at all but goes to meet every danger becomes rash and similarly the man who indulges in every pleasure and abstains from none becomes self indulgent, while the man who shuns every pleasure, as boors do, becomes in a way insensible. Temperance and courage, then, are destroyed by excess and defect, and preserved by the mean. So too is it with the virtues. By abstaining from pleasures we become temperate and it is when we have become so that we are most able to abstain from them and similarly too in the case of courage, for by being habituated to despise things that are terrible and to stand our ground against them we become brave, and it is when we have become so that we shall be most able to stand our ground against them But as there is no excess and deficiency of temperance and courage because what is intermediate is in a sense an extreme, so too of the actions we have mentioned there is no mean nor any excessand deficiency, but however they are done they are wrong; for ingeneral there is neither a mean of excess and deficiency, nor excess and deficiency of a mean With regard to feelings of fear and confidence courage is the mean; of the people who exceed, he who exceeds in fearlessness has no name, while the man who exceeds in confidence is rash, and he who exceeds in fear and falls short in confidence is a coward Again, to the intermediate some extremes show a certain likeness, as that of rashness to courage and that of prodigality to liberality but the extremes show the greatest unlikeness to each other. Now contrariesare defined as the things that are furthest from each other, so that things that are further apart are more contrary it is not rashness, which is an excess, but cowardice, which is a deficiency, that is more opposed to courage, and not insensibility, which is a deficiency, but self-indulgence, which is an excess, that is more opposed to temperance since rashness is thought liker and nearer to courage, and cowardice more unlike, we oppose rather the latter to courage; for things that are further from the intermediate are thought more contrary to it Witness seems to be borne to this both by individuals in their private capacity and by legislators themselves; for these punish andtake vengeance on those who do wicked acts, while they honour those who do noble acts, as though they meant to encourage the latter and deter the former But noone is encouraged to do the things that are neither in our power nor voluntary. It is assumed that there is no gain in being persuaded not to be hot or in pain or hungry or the like, since we shall experience these feelings none the less And first let us speak of courage At the same time, we show courage in situations where there is the opportunity of showing prowess or where death is noble but in these forms of death neither of these conditions is fulfilled But courage is noble. Therefore it is for a noble end that the brave man endures and acts as courage directs The rash man, however, is also thought to be boastful and only a pretender to courage. At all events, as the brave man is with regard to what is terrible, so the rash man wishes to appear and so he imitates him in situations where he can As we have said, then, courage is a mean with respect to things that inspire confidence or fear, in the circumstances that have been stated; and it chooses or endures things because it is noble to do so,or because it is base not to do so Courage, then, is something of this sort, but the name is also applied to five other kinds. First comes the courage of the citizen soldier, for this is most like true courage This kind of courage is most like to that which we described earlier, because it is due to virtue, for it is due to shame and to desire of a noble object. This is indeed the reason why Socrates thought courage was knowledge Passion also is sometimes reckoned as courage. Those who act from passion, like wild beasts rushing at those who have wounded them, are thought to be brave, because brave men also are passionate; for passion above all things is eager to rush on danger, and hence Homers put strength into his passion and aroused their spirit and passion and hard he breathed panting and his blood boiled. The courage that is due to passion seems to be the most natural, and to be courage if choice and motive be added Men, then, as well as beasts, suffer pain when they are angry, and are pleased when they exact their revenge. Those who fight for these reasons, however, are pugnacious but not brave, for they do not act for honours sake nor as the rule directs, but from strength of feeling. They have, however, something akin to courage though courage is concerned with feelings of confidence and of fear, it is not concerned with both alike, but more with the things that inspire fear. For he who is undisturbed in face of these and bears himself as he should towards these is more truly brave than the man who does so towards the things that inspire confidence. Hence also courage involves pain, and is justly praised; for it is harder to face what is painful than to abstain from what is pleasant Yet the end which courage sets before it would seem to be pleasant, but to be concealed by the attending circumstances, as happens also in athletic contests, for the end at which boxers aim is pleasant. The crown and the honours but the blows they take are distressing to flesh and blood, and painful, and so is their whole exertion and because the blows and the exertions are many the end, which is but small, appears to have nothing pleasant in it And so, if the case of courage is similar, death and wounds will be painful to the brave man and against his will, but he will face them because it is noble to do so or because it is base not to do so So much, then, for courage; it is not difficult to grasp its nature in outline, at any rate, from what has been said After courage let us speak of temperance, for these seem to be the virtues of the irrational parts Plainly, then, excess with regard to pleasures is self-indulgence and is culpable and with regard to pains one is not, as in the case of courage, called temperate for facing them or self-indulgent for not doing so, but the self indulgent man is so called because he ispained more than he ought at not getting pleasant things and the temperate man is so called because he is not pained at the absence of what is pleasant and at his abstinence from it Now if arguments were in themselves enough to make men good, they would justly, as Theognis says, have won very great rewards, and such rewards should have been provided but as things are, while they seem to have power to encourage and stimulate the generous-minded among our youth, and to make a character which is gently born, and at rue lover of what is noble, ready to be possessed by virtue, they are not able to encourage the many to nobility and goodness.\\n'"

              "'Goods also give rise to a similar fluctuation because they bring harm to many people for before now men have been undone by reason of their wealth, and others by reason of their courage. So too is it, then, in the case of temperance and courage and the other virtues. For the man who flies from and fears everything and does not stand his ground against anything becomes a coward, and the man who fears nothing at all but goes to meet every danger becomes rash and similarly the man who indulges in every pleasure and abstains from none becomes self indulgent, while the man who shuns every pleasure, as boors do, becomes in a way insensible. Temperance and courage, then, are destroyed by excess and defect, and preserved by the mean. So too is it with the virtues. By abstaining from pleasures we become temperate and it is when we have become so that we are most able to abstain from them and similarly too in the case of courage, for by being habituated to despise things that are terrible and to stand our ground against them we become brave, and it is when we have become so that we shall be most able to stand our ground against them But as there is no excess and deficiency of temperance and courage because what is intermediate is in a sense an extreme, so too of the actions we have mentioned there is no mean nor any excessand deficiency, but however they are done they are wrong; for ingeneral there is neither a mean of excess and deficiency, nor excess and deficiency of a mean With regard to feelings of fear and confidence courage is the mean; of the people who exceed, he who exceeds in fearlessness has no name, while the man who exceeds in confidence is rash, and he who exceeds in fear and falls short in confidence is a coward Again, to the intermediate some extremes show a certain likeness, as that of rashness to courage and that of prodigality to liberality but the extremes show the greatest unlikeness to each other. Now contrariesare defined as the things that are furthest from each other, so that things that are further apart are more contrary it is not rashness, which is an excess, but cowardice, which is a deficiency, that is more opposed to courage, and not insensibility, which is a deficiency, but self-indulgence, which is an excess, that is more opposed to temperance since rashness is thought liker and nearer to courage, and cowardice more unlike, we oppose rather the latter to courage; for things that are further from the intermediate are thought more contrary to it Witness seems to be borne to this both by individuals in their private capacity and by legislators themselves; for these punish andtake vengeance on those who do wicked acts, while they honour those who do noble acts, as though they meant to encourage the latter and deter the former But noone is encouraged to do the things that are neither in our power nor voluntary. It is assumed that there is no gain in being persuaded not to be hot or in pain or hungry or the like, since we shall experience these feelings none the less And first let us speak of courage At the same time, we show courage in situations where there is the opportunity of showing prowess or where death is noble but in these forms of death neither of these conditions is fulfilled But courage is noble. Therefore it is for a noble end that the brave man endures and acts as courage directs The rash man, however, is also thought to be boastful and only a pretender to courage. At all events, as the brave man is with regard to what is terrible, so the rash man wishes to appear and so he imitates him in situations where he can As we have said, then, courage is a mean with respect to things that inspire confidence or fear, in the circumstances that have been stated; and it chooses or endures things because it is noble to do so,or because it is base not to do so Courage, then, is something of this sort, but the name is also applied to five other kinds. First comes the courage of the citizen soldier, for this is most like true courage This kind of courage is most like to that which we described earlier, because it is due to virtue, for it is due to shame and to desire of a noble object. This is indeed the reason why Socrates thought courage was knowledge Passion also is sometimes reckoned as courage. Those who act from passion, like wild beasts rushing at those who have wounded them, are thought to be brave, because brave men also are passionate; for passion above all things is eager to rush on danger, and hence Homers put strength into his passion and aroused their spirit and passion and hard he breathed panting and his blood boiled. The courage that is due to passion seems to be the most natural, and to be courage if choice and motive be added Men, then, as well as beasts, suffer pain when they are angry, and are pleased when they exact their revenge. Those who fight for these reasons, however, are pugnacious but not brave, for they do not act for honours sake nor as the rule directs, but from strength of feeling. They have, however, something akin to courage though courage is concerned with feelings of confidence and of fear, it is not concerned with both alike, but more with the things that inspire fear. For he who is undisturbed in face of these and bears himself as he should towards these is more truly brave than the man who does so towards the things that inspire confidence. Hence also courage involves pain, and is justly praised; for it is harder to face what is painful than to abstain from what is pleasant Yet the end which courage sets before it would seem to be pleasant, but to be concealed by the attending circumstances, as happens also in athletic contests, for the end at which boxers aim is pleasant. The crown and the honours but the blows they take are distressing to flesh and blood, and painful, and so is their whole exertion and because the blows and the exertions are many the end, which is but small, appears to have nothing pleasant in it And so, if the case of courage is similar, death and wounds will be painful to the brave man and against his will, but he will face them because it is noble to do so or because it is base not to do so So much, then, for courage; it is not difficult to grasp its nature in outline, at any rate, from what has been said After courage let us speak of temperance, for these seem to be the virtues of the irrational parts Plainly, then, excess with regard to pleasures is self-indulgence and is culpable and with regard to pains one is not, as in the case of courage, called temperate for facing them or self-indulgent for not doing so, but the self indulgent man is so called because he ispained more than he ought at not getting pleasant things and the temperate man is so called because he is not pained at the absence of what is pleasant and at his abstinence from it Now if arguments were in themselves enough to make men good, they would justly, as Theognis says, have won very great rewards, and such rewards should have been provided but as things are, while they seem to have power to encourage and stimulate the generous-minded among our youth, and to make a character which is gently born, and at rue lover of what is noble, ready to be possessed by virtue, they are not able to encourage the many to nobility and goodness.\\n'"

At all events, as the brave man is with regard to what is terrible, so the rash man wishes to appear and so he imitates him in situations where he can As we have said, then, courage is a mean with respect to things that inspire confidence or fear, in the circumstances that have been stated; and it chooses or endures things because it is noble to do so,or because it is base not to do so Courage, then, is something of this sort, but the name is also applied to five other kinds. The crown and the honours but the blows they take are distressing to flesh and blood, and painful, and so is their whole exertion and because the blows and the exertions are many the end, which is but small, appears to have nothing pleasant in it And so, if the case of courage is similar, death and wounds will be painful to the brave man and against his will, but he will face them because it is noble to do so or because it is base not to do so So much, then, for courage; it is not difficult to grasp its nature in outline, at any rate, from what has been said After courage let us speak of temperance, for these seem to be the virtues of the irrational parts Plainly, then, excess with regard to pleasures is self-indulgence and is culpable and with regard to pains one is not, as in the case of courage, called temperate for facing them or self-indulgent for not doing so, but the self indulgent man is so called because he ispained more than he ought at not getting pleasant things and the temperate man is so called because he is not pained at the absence of what is pleasant and at his abstinence from it Now if arguments were in themselves enough to make men good, they would justly, as Theognis says, have won very great rewards, and such rewards should have been provided but as things are, while they seem to have power to encourage and stimulate the generous-minded among our youth, and to make a character which is gently born, and at rue lover of what is noble, ready to be possessed by virtue, they are not able to encourage the many to nobility and goodness.'"
